# **Smart Chatbot with LLM**

This project demonstrates a chatbot powered by a **Language Model (LLM)** that answers questions by pulling information from webpages and CSV files. Using **LangChain**, the chatbot processes documents, breaks them into smaller chunks, and provides relevant answers.

This project demonstrates my ability to effectively use Language Models (LLMs) to extract and process information from various data sources, enabling the creation of intelligent, data-driven chatbots.

## **Tools Used**
- **LLM (Language Model)**: For understanding questions and generating responses.
- **LangChain**: For processing and splitting documents.
- **Python**: For building the chatbot.

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Extraction**: The chatbot scrapes webpages or reads CSV files.
2. **Query Processing**: It searches for the most relevant data.
3. **Answer Generation**: The LLM creates responses based on the extracted information.
